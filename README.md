# DogClassifier
A CNN Dog Classifier in python 3 w/Tensorflow.

## Data Understanding
Starting with the Stanford Dog Dataset: [ImageNetDogs]](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).  This gives me:
> *Number of categories:* 120
*Number of images:* 20,580
*Annotations:* Class labels, Bounding boxes

Which feels like a good number of dogs to use.

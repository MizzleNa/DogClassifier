# DogClassifier
A CNN Dog Classifier in python 3 w/Tensorflow.

## Data Understanding
Starting with the Stanford Dog Dataset: [ImageNetDogs](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).  This gives me:
> **Number of categories:** 120

> **Number of images:** 20,580

> **Annotations:** Class labels, Bounding boxes

The images have the following characteristics:
* *jpg* format
* No uniform size
* Some have humans in them
* Some have multiple dogs
